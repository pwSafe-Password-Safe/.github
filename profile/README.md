## 📌 Overview

pwSafe for macOS is a focused, security-first password manager that keeps your credentials under your control. It stores passwords, notes, and secure items in an encrypted vault you own, so your most sensitive data is protected even when your Mac is offline. With a clean macOS-native UI, pwSafe favors speed and clarity over clutter.

The app streamlines everyday sign-ins with quick search, one-click copy, and customizable fields. Powerful grouping and tagging keep large vaults tidy; a global search surfaces accounts in milliseconds. Because the data is in your local vault (with optional cloud sync you choose), you decide where it lives and how it’s backed up.

Modern macOS technologies make daily use effortless. System-wide shortcuts, menu-bar access, and tight clipboard handling reduce friction without compromising security. Auto-lock, timeout controls, and clipboard scrubbing prevent accidental leaks when you step away from your Mac.

pwSafe plays well with your browser workflow. The Safari extension can fill logins into websites while keeping secrets in your encrypted database. For apps outside the browser, pwSafe’s quick copy and auto-type patterns get credentials where they need to go, fast.

Security practices are practical and transparent. You choose a strong master password; pwSafe encrypts the vault and never transmits your secrets unencrypted. Optional cloud sync routes (iCloud Drive, Dropbox, etc.) are your decision, and you can stay fully local if you prefer.

Whether you’re a developer juggling API keys, a power user maintaining hundreds of accounts, or a family organizing shared logins, pwSafe brings dependable password management to macOS with a lightweight footprint and professional safeguards.

## ℹ️ About pwSafe for Mac (Expanded)

pwSafe was built around a simple idea: **your passwords should be yours**—encrypted by you, accessible by you, and recoverable by you. Instead of locking users into proprietary clouds, it prioritizes a **standards-minded vault** you can back up, move, and store where you trust it most. That philosophy shapes every part of the experience on macOS.

At its core is strong encryption and a single master password—easy to use, hard to break. pwSafe focuses on the essentials: generate unique passwords, store them securely, and retrieve them instantly. It avoids the bloat that slows other managers, so opening, searching, and copying are snappy even with very large databases.

Organization scales gracefully from dozens to thousands of entries. **Groups, tags, and custom fields** help model real-world accounts: separate environments, roles, or clients; add OTP seeds, recovery codes, notes, or security questions. A consistent, keyboard-friendly UI lowers the barrier to keeping data accurate and up to date.

On the Mac, **integration matters**. pwSafe respects macOS conventions—menu-bar quick access, native dialogs, accent colors, and system security features. Clipboard and auto-lock policies balance convenience with safety; you can tune timeouts and wipe behaviors to match your workspace and risk profile.

The **Safari extension** streamlines web sign-ins without exposing your vault to third parties. It reads the login you choose, fills only what’s needed, and returns control to the app. For complex workflows, templates and auto-type macros make pasting credentials into desktop apps or terminal sessions predictable and fast.

Finally, the data lifecycle is yours to control. Prefer offline only? Keep the vault local. Need cross-device access? Point pwSafe to a sync location you trust. Want auditable backups? Store versioned vault files in your own repo or encrypted disk. pwSafe’s job is to protect the secrets and stay out of your way.
